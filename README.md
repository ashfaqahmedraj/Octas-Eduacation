The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface that allows authorized individuals, such as administrators or staff, to efficiently handle student and teacher records. By leveraging PHP, I developed the back-end logic to handle data manipulation operations, while HTML and CSS enable you to create a visually appealing and responsive front-end design.

The project's key functionalities include:

<b>Data Display:</b> The system will display existing student and teacher information, such as names, contact details, and other relevant data, in a structured format.

<b>Add Data:</b> Authorized users can input new student or teacher information using a form. The form will validate the data and send it to the server for storage in the MySQL database.

<b>Update Data:</b> Users will have the ability to modify existing student or teacher records. They can edit specific fields or update multiple fields simultaneously, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

<b>Delete Data:</b> Users can remove student or teacher records from the system. Adequate confirmation mechanisms should be in place to prevent accidental deletion.

<b>Search and Filter:</b> The system will incorporate search and filter functionality to allow users to quickly find specific student or teacher records based on various criteria, such as name, ID, or subject taught.

<b>User Authorization:</b> Implementing user authentication will ensure that only authorized individuals can access and manipulate the data. User roles and permissions can be established to control the level of access and actions allowed.

<b>Data Security:</b> It is crucial to implement secure practices to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the data. Measures like encryption and secure database connections should be implemented to safeguard sensitive information.

By combining PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL, My project aims to deliver an efficient, secure, and user-friendly system for managing student and teacher data.
